# Geomtrical_algorithms

This project is applying two different algorithms for geometery algorithms.

The comments and a detailed ReadMe file would be added to this repository shortly.

The main function consist of creating an object of a parent class gemoethric algorithm which consists of two method. One to read the input, and a solve method. Each algorithm has its own class and is a virtual inheritance of others. This is because taking care of not copying any objects.
Other algorithms would also deploy in short time.
